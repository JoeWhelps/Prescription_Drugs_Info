Here is the link to the website:

This code is for a Prescription Drug information website. Data was taken from the FDAs API, cleaned, and then fed into Python models in order to analyze and make claims.

Index.html is the main file which all the other files link to so go there to get a sense of the website's inner structure.

Thanks for reading and have a great day!
